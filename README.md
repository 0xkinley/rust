# Rust 

## Why Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language designed to provide high performance, memory safety, and concurrency without sacrificing expressiveness. Some of the key reasons to use Rust are:

- **Memory Safety**: Rust ensures memory safety by enforcing ownership rules and preventing null pointer dereferencing, buffer overflows, and data races.
- **Concurrency**: Rust's ownership system eliminates data races at compile-time, making concurrent programming easier and safer.
- **Performance**: Rust has minimal runtime, and its memory management is done at compile time, making it nearly as fast as C and C++.
- **Expressiveness**: Rust has a rich type system and powerful pattern matching, making it ideal for writing clear and maintainable code.

## How to Install Rust

1. Install Rust using `rustup`, the recommended way to install and manage Rust versions. Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   
2. After installation, restart your terminal or run:

   ```bash
   source $HOME/.cargo/env
  
3. To confirm Rust is installed, run::

   ```bash
   rustc --version

4. You can also install additional components like cargo, Rust's build system and package manager, with::

   ```bash
   rustup update
